# Plant Disease Classification

## Overview
CNN-based plant disease classification system developed during an ML internship as a prototype for agricultural diagnostics.

## Approach
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Transfer learning using VGG16
- Model training and validation on plant leaf datasets

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Computer Vision, Transfer Learning

## Notes
This project was designed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the application of deep learning for real-world agricultural use cases.
